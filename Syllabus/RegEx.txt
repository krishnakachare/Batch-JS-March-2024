Introduction to Regular Expressions

Overview: Explanation of what regular expressions are and their importance in string manipulation tasks.
Syntax: Introduction to the basic syntax of regular expressions, including delimiters and special characters.
Literal Characters: Understanding how literal characters are matched in regular expressions.
Basic Patterns

Metacharacters: Explanation of special characters with unique meanings in regular expressions, such as ., ^, $, and \.
Character Classes: Understanding character classes and their usage in matching sets of characters, including examples like [aeiou].
Quantifiers: Explanation of quantifiers for specifying the number of occurrences of a pattern, such as *, +, ?, {n}, {n,}, {n,m}.
Alternation: Introduction to alternation with the pipe symbol (|) for matching multiple patterns.
Anchors and Boundaries

Anchors: Understanding anchors like ^ (start of string) and $ (end of string) for matching specific positions in the input string.
Word Boundaries: Explanation of word boundaries \b and \B for matching the beginning or end of a word.
Character Classes

Predefined Character Classes: Introduction to predefined character classes like \d, \w, \s, and their opposites.
Custom Character Classes: Explanation of how to create custom character classes to match specific sets of characters.
Grouping and Capturing

Grouping: Understanding how to use parentheses () for grouping subexpressions in regular expressions.
Capturing Groups: Explanation of capturing groups and how to extract parts of the match for later use.
Modifiers and Flags

Modifiers: Introduction to modifiers like i (case-insensitive), g (global), and m (multiline) for modifying matching behavior.
Flags: Understanding how to use flags with regular expressions to enable specific matching options.
Escaping Special Characters

Escaping: Explanation of how to escape special characters in regular expressions using the backslash \.
Methods for Regular Expressions

test() Method: Explanation of the test() method for testing if a pattern exists in a string and returning true or false.
exec() Method: Understanding the exec() method for searching a string for a specified pattern and returning the first match, along with additional details.
match() Method: Introduction to the match() method for returning an array containing all matches of a pattern in a string.
search() Method: Explanation of the search() method for searching a string for a specified pattern and returning the index of the first match.
replace() Method: Understanding the replace() method for searching a string for a specified pattern and replacing matches with a replacement string.
Advanced Regular Expressions

Backreferences: Introduction to backreferences for referencing previously captured groups within a regular expression.
Lookahead and Lookbehind Assertions: Explanation of lookahead (?=...) and lookbehind (?<=...) assertions for asserting patterns ahead or behind the current position.
Non-capturing Groups: Understanding non-capturing groups (?:...) for grouping subexpressions without capturing the match.
Practice and Application

Practical Examples: Hands-on exercises and examples to practice applying regular expressions to real-world scenarios.
Applications: Discussion of common applications of regular expressions in tasks such as validation, parsing, and data extraction.
