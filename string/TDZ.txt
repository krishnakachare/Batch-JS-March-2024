1. It is related to the let and const variable declarations.
2. It's a specific phase during the variable's lifecycle where accessing the variable results in a ReferenceError.

In the example, when we try to console.log the myLet variable before its declaration, JavaScript throws a ReferenceError. This happens because myLet is in the temporal dead zone until it's actually declared with let.

On the other hand, the var declaration is hoisted, meaning the variable is moved to the top of its scope and initialized with a value of undefined. So, console.log(myVar) will output undefined without any error.
